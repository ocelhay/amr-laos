Antibiotic susceptibility testing of a multi-drug resistant *Escherichia coli* isolated from the urine of a 51 year old Lao patient with a perinephric abscess. There are no inhibition zones surrounding any of the antibiotic disks, including meropenem (MEM, 12 o’clock position), a ‘last-line’ antibiotic. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that this isolate was carrying a NDM-5 carbapenemase. Such infections are likely to become more frequent, given the ability of carbapenemases to spread and the increasing availability of meropenem in Laos.
